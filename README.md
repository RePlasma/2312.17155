Abstract: _The quantum fluctuations of fields can exhibit subtle correlations in space and time. As the interval between a pair of measurements varies, the correlation function can change sign, signaling a shift between correlation and anti-correlation. A numerical simulation of the fluctuations requires a knowledge of both the probability distribution and the correlation function. Although there are widely used methods to generate a sequence of random numbers which obey a given probability distribution, the imposition of a given correlation function can be more difficult. Here we propose a simple method in which the outcome of a given measurement determines a shift in the peak of the probability distribution, to be used for the next measurement. We illustrate this method for three examples of quantum field correlation functions, and show that the resulting simulated function agree well with the original, analytically derived function. We then discuss the application of this method to numerical studies of the effects of correlations on the random walks of test particles coupled to the fluctuating field._
